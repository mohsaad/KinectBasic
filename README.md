# KinectBasic
This application simply takes the Kinect Data Stream and displays it on the screen.

There are two display windows, one for the RGB stream (your normal camera) and one for the Depth stream (a visualization of how far you are from the Kinect). 

To build, run in Visual Studio and then press Build.
